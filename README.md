## React implementation of Minesweeper

This is my first single page application I built with React to train the basic concepts, such as passing props, managing and lifting up state, css modules and useEffect.

At first, I tried to use the useContext hook to write the game logic, but I then decided that it would be a good opportunity to practice some Redux! So, the general game logic is now implemented using React Redux and the Redux toolkit. 

You can view the app here: [https://react-minesweeper.onrender.com](https://react-minesweeper.onrender.com).

Design is inspired by/copied from Google's Minesweeper.
